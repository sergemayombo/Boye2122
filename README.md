# Boye2122
In this repository, I save all the R scripts and dataset used for running statistical analysis for our SFB RESIST Boye 2021 and 2022 microphytobenthos sampling campaign data. These include abundance data from microscopy and 18S-V9 amplicon sequencing data. We run multivariate statistical analyses to test the response of microphytobenthoic communities to multiple stressors in this former sewage channels but also check whether community composition respond to time since restoration.
